# RandomForest-Regression-Analysis-for-Solar-Pond
Developed an AI-powered framework to predict thermal behavior in salt gradient solar ponds using Random Forest Regression, targeting the UCZ and LCZ temperature profiles 


Enabled design optimization of solar ponds through a computationally efficient surrogate model, offering rapid thermal performance assessment without full-scale numerical simulations 


Constructed a MATLAB-based thermal model incorporating energy balance equations to simulate solar pond behavior under realistic operating conditions 


Generated a comprehensive dataset using 10 input parameters (e.g., solar radiation, pond geometry, ambient conditions) across 6 global locations 


Applied Random Forest Regression to model non-linear dependencies between environmental inputs and thermal outputs, using ensemble learning for robustness and accuracy 


Enhanced prediction accuracy through data preprocessing techniques, including correlation-based feature filtering to remove low-impact parameters 


Tuned hyperparameters like number of estimators to balance prediction performance and model complexity 


Achieved high prediction accuracy with the Random Forest model:
MAPE < 5% across most locations
R² ≈ 0.98, indicating strong agreement with simulated ground truth


Demonstrated generalizability across diverse climates, validating the model’s use in early-stage design workflows
